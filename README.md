# AI

My first machine learning program in C++. *AI* trains adding numbers together. The backpropagation algorithm is programmed from scratch. The output is the total error of the neural net after training for addition.

# Usage

(*build.sh* uses g++ for building)

Compilation:

`chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh`

Running the program:

`./main`
